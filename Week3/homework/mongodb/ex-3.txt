1. An example of a value that can be passed as name and code to exploit SQL injection vulnerability would be:

name = "'; DROP TABLE Countries; -- "
code = "1234"

The above values will manipulate the query to drop the entire "Countries" table in the database.


2. To prevent SQL injection, we can use parameterized queries. Here's the modified function that uses parameterized queries:

function getPopulation(Country, name, code, cb) {
  // assuming that connection to the database is established and stored as conn
  conn.query(
    "SELECT Population FROM ?? WHERE Name = ? and code = ?",
    [Country, name, code],
    function (err, result) {
      if (err) cb(err);
      if (result.length == 0) cb(new Error("Not found"));
      cb(null, result[0].Population);
    }
  );
}
